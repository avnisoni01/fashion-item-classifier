## Overview

The Fashion Item Classifier is a simple web application that allows users to upload an image of a fashion item and get a prediction of what the item is. The model used in this project is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 10 different classes of fashion items.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-item-classifier.git
    cd fashion-item-classifier
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the pre-trained model and place it in the `trained_model` folder.

## Usage

To run the web application, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local web server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to use the application.

## Model Training

The pre-trained model `fashion_model.h5` is a TensorFlow model trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. If you want to retrain the model, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. Train a neural network model using TensorFlow or Keras.
3. Save the trained model in the `trained_model` directory.
